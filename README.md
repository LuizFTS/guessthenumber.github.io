<h1>Guess the Number</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    It's my first project inspired by a JavaScript class where you need to guess a number between 1 and 10. If your
    guess is correct, a green text saying "Acertou!" (you guessed correctly in Portuguese) will appear. Otherwise, the
    text color will be red, and it will say "Perdeu!" (you've lost in Portuguese).
  </p>

  <p>
    The difference between this project and the one I learned in the JS course is that you will click on a number block
    instead of typing the number. If you guess correctly, the background color of the clicked block will turn green. If
    your guess is wrong, it will turn red, and you will have five guesses in total.
